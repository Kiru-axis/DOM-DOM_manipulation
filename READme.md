_whatever is in the html document also has to be in the DOM._

#### Handling click events:

- These is achieved by using an event listener.
- An event is anything that happens on the page eg. mouseclick or a key press.
- The eventListener waits for such an event to happen and then react to it.
- The addEventListener takes two arguements i.e the "event" and the event handler function which specifies what will happen when you you use the "event".
